# Unity Virtual World "Wilderness"

## About
Wilderness is a project narrative with a post-apocalyptic city, metro system, spaceship and the alien, and a video-game-like teaser. 
I set up an unordinary neon lighting to emphasize the unique atmosphere of my virtual world, created a post-apocalyptic and horror environment using the special props, effects and music, and added elements of my culture into the narrative to give it more of a unique, personalized style.
